deploy a public machine learning web app, use Streamlit and share the app's link for others to access
In this project, I deploy a public machine learning web app, use Streamlit and share the app's link for others to access and interact with my machine learning models. The model is Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier 
that predict a person with specific feature has Diabetes or not.
The deployment requires a few key files: a Python file with Streamlit code, three model files (saved as .sav), and a requirements.txt file listing necessary libraries.
The requirements.txt file specifies the required libraries and their versions.
